           The Sisters of Battle, like the rest of the Adepta Sororitas, trace their history back to the troubled times of the Age of Apostasy. On a backwater world named San Leor an all-female cult dedicated to the worship of the Emperor, known as the "Daughters of the Emperor", were discovered by members of the Ecclesiarchy. Goge Vandire, the High Lord of the Administratum (and also Ecclesiarch of the Adeptus Ministorum), decided to visit San Leor and recruit the Daughters into his own private army. The Daughters were then renamed the "Brides of the Emperor" and became Lord Vandire's most loyal followers.[Needs Citation]

As the events of the Age of Apostasy progressed the Adeptus Custodes, the praetorians of the Emperor himself, tried to approach the Brides and convince them of Vandire's treachery. In a last ditch effort to convince them, the Custodes took Alicia Dominica, leader of the Brides, and her chosen bodyguards deep into the Imperial Palace where they stood before the Emperor himself. What happened there remains unknown - Dominica and her companions were sworn to secrecy - but it became clear that the Brides, who then reverted to their original title of Daughters of the Emperor, had been awakened to the evil that Vandire represented. Marching into his audience chamber, Dominica paused only to condemn Vandire for his crimes before she beheaded the power-crazed dictator.
